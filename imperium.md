### Long
🔱 Imperium Mechanika — A Roman Steampunk Tech Expansion
Combining the grandeur of Rome with the industrial wonder of classic steampunk.

Step into a world where imperial order meets mechanical ambition. Imperium Mechanika blends the atmosphere of classic steampunk, a touch of Airship Tales, and a tinge of Victorian futurism — all wrapped in the symbolism, structure, and strength of a Roman Empire that never fell.

Developed primarily to complement and expand the Basileia Romaion tech tree, Imperium Mechanika adds an entirely new branch of steampunk-inspired military, production, and society technologies. Together, the two mods create a vast, immersive, and thematically unified technological overhaul that goes far beyond vanilla Victoria 3.

While designed with Basileia Romaion in mind, Imperium Mechanika runs independently of vanilla tech trees and is structured for broad compatibility with most other mods.

⚙️ Key Features
Three fully independent tech trees
Each tree is built from scratch, beginning at Tier 3 and designed for clean progression:

Military – Steam-powered infantry, landships, mechanical ballistae, and siege behemoths

Production – Industrial forges, modular factories, aetheric mining, and centralized refineries

Society – Automated bureaucracies, pneumatic governance, mechanized healthcare, and more

Original technologies with thematic depth
Including Automatoi Stratiotai, Grammateia Automatika, Kleisoura Behemoths, Asty Aitheromekhanon, and many others — all with immersive descriptions and custom modifiers

Custom iconography in a unified Roman steampunk style
Designed for visual clarity and thematic consistency — blending imperial symbolism with mechanical form
Note: Some icons are currently reused or in-progress; Phase Two will introduce more unique art and polish existing assets

Modular structure for balance and compatibility
The tech trees are standalone from vanilla, ensuring smooth integration and avoiding limitations of the base game tech structure

🛠️ Ongoing Development
Imperium Mechanika is being developed in structured phases:

Phase One – Initial release of military, production, and society trees

Phase Two – New production methods, laws, and institutions; unique icons for all technologies; expanded modifiers and visual consistency

Phase Three – Tier 6–7 technologies featuring darker, dieselpunk-inspired advancements

Future Phases – Narrative flavor, decisions, events, art polish, and deeper alternate-history integration
