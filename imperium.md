⚙️⚙️⚙️-Imperium Mechanika-⚙️⚙️⚙️ — A Roman Steampunk Tech Expansion
Combining the grandeur of Rome with the industrial wonder of classic steampunk.

Enter an era where gears turn beneath imperial banners.
Imperium Mechanika combines classic steampunk aesthetics, the soaring spirit of Airship Tales, and the polished brass of Victorian futurism — all bound by the enduring symbolism and structure of the Roman Empire that never fell.

Developed primarily to complement and expand the Basileía Romaíon tech tree, Imperium Mechanika adds an entirely new branch of steampunk-inspired military, production, and society technologies. Together, the two mods create a vast, immersive, and thematically unified technological overhaul that goes far beyond vanilla Victoria 3.

Modular structure for balance and compatibility
While Imperium Mechanika is designed to complement the expanded tech tree of Basileía Romaíon, it functions independently of both vanilla Victoria 3 and the 40+ new technologies introduced by BR. This modular approach ensures ease of entry, flexible balancing, and broad compatibility with other content and mods.

⚙️ Key Features
Three fully independent tech trees
Each tree is built from scratch, beginning at Tier 3 and designed for clean progression:

Military – Steam-powered infantry, landships, mechanical ballistae, and siege behemoths

Production – Industrial forges, modular factories, aetheric mining, and centralized refineries

Society – Automated bureaucracies, pneumatic governance, mechanized healthcare, and more

Original technologies with thematic depth
Technologies such as Automatoi Stratiotai, Grammateia Automatika, Kleisoura Behemoths, and Asty Aitheromekhanon reflect the hybrid cultural and industrial vision of the Roman Machine Age.
Names are inspired by the medieval Greek of the late Roman Empire. — in keeping with the world of Basileía Romaíon and reinforcing immersion with additional steampunk flavor.

Custom iconography in a unified Roman steampunk style
Designed for clarity and aesthetic cohesion — combining imperial symbols with realistic mechanical forms
Note: Some icons are currently reused or in-progress; Further updates will bring more unique visual assets and upgrades


🛠️ Ongoing Development
Imperium Mechanika is being developed in structured phases:

Phase One – Initial release of the full military, production, and society tech trees

Phase Two – Expanded integration of techs into laws, production methods, and institutions; more unique icons and revised visuals

Phase Three – Tier 6–7 technologies featuring darker, dieselpunk-inspired advancements

Future Phases – Narrative flavor, decisions, events, visual polish, and deeper alternate-history integration

The Senate runs on steam. The law is delivered by piston. The eagle soars on fire and iron.
